# 🔐 Basic Keystroke Logger using Python (Tkinter)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **basic keystroke logging application** developed using **Python and Tkinter**.
The application records keyboard inputs when the logging is started and stores them in a text file.
It is designed **strictly for educational purposes** to understand keyboard event handling and GUI-based applications in Python.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – Graphical User Interface
- **pynput / keyboard module** – Keystroke capturing
- **File Handling** – Saving keystrokes to a text file

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Simple and user-friendly GUI
- Start and Stop keystroke logging
- Logs keystrokes in real-time
- Saves output to a `.txt` file
- Easy to understand and modify

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User runs the Python script
2. Tkinter GUI window opens
3. Click **Start Logging** to begin capturing keystrokes
4. All keystrokes are recorded
5. Click **Stop Logging** to end logging
6. Logged keys are saved in a text file
